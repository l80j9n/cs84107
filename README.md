Programming   Assignment   2
Due:   August   9th   (11:59pm)
RequirementsThis   assignment   requires   you   to   write   ﬁve   efficient   algorithms   that   processes   intervals.    At   least   three of them should be implemented via some type of greedy algorithm.   It is worth 5% of your total course   marks.All   ﬁve programs have   the same input and output format.   The   input   will   begin   with   an   integer n   ≤   1000   denoting how many testcases.   This is followed by n lines of   an even number   2m of   whitespace separated   integers:
a1      b1      a2      b2      a3      b3         . . .    am       bm
Each   pairs   [ai   ,   bi]   denotes   a   closed   interval   where   it   is   guaranteed   that   ai      ≤   bi      for   1   ≤   i   ≤   m.    The   output will be a single integer per line denoting the   answer   to   the   following   questions.
Problem   1:
Print   the   sum   of   the   lengths   of   all   intervals.
Problem   2:
Find the   smallest   gap   length   between   any two   non-overlapping   intervals.    If no   gaps then   output   the   range of代 写Computer Science 320 S2 – (2024) Programming Assignment 2Python

Problem   3:
Determine the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.
Problem   4:
Find   the   maximum   number   of   intervals   that   overlap   at   a   single   point   (on   x-axis).
Problem   5:
Compute the largest contiguous interval obtained by taking a union of some of the   input   intervals.
SubmissionThese   problem   requirements   will   each   be   worth   1   marks.    Sumbit   diferent   solutions   to   the   computer science automarker https://www.automarker.cs.auckland.ac.nz/.   For this assignment you need to   use the Python programming   language and can submit up to 8 times for   each   problem   before   occuring   a 20%   penalty.
